          As the Home Department Head of the Simi Valley world market, I am in charge of maintaining the visual standards and leading sales of he major ticket items of the store. I assure that each item is properly stocked, signed, and displayed. In addition, I lead the floor in sales and make sure each of our associates are greeting each customer and providing them with excellent service.

          I coordinate the customer order system for the store as well which requires that I organize all incoming, recieved, and processed customer orders and to coordinate with customers to let them know their item is either ready for them or waitlisted.

          Home Department Heads are given access to the store key and act as Managers whenever there is no supervisor present. I have experience in opening and closing the store and running the store entirely.
