        <h1>Aquaponics Manager</h1>
          During my time at Loyola, I was the manager of the universityâ€™s feature greenhouse located in the main building of <div class="bub-image" id="greenhouse-air"></div> the Institute of Environmental Sustainability. There, I led a team of 3-4 interns during the week along with 15 volunteers on weekends to maintain the greenhouse and the aquaponics system housed within it. I led the interns during their semester-long internships and both trained and managed them during their time in <div class="bub-image" id="basil"></div> the greenhouse. I also had the privilege of making changes and improvements to the system that both reduced maintenance time and hassle and increased productivity of the system. This gave me the opportunity to find solutions to the problems we were having and implement these solutions based on cost and feasibility. I left the position after my graduation with invaluable experience in management, communication, and project leadership during my two years as Aquaponics Manager.

        This is a short video created by fox news where they visited my campus and talked about our sustainability efforts. I was able to talk about aquaponics and my education as a part of this video and  show what I was working on and what I valued in my college experience.

          <h1>Wind Ensemble and Jazz Band</h1>
          Music has been a passion of mine for over 12 years now. I have had the honor of playing for a number of great school programs and in each have striven for excellence. I play the trombone <div class="bub-image" id="jazz-band"></div>and the euphonium; I primarily play jazz on trombone and exclusivley play classical on the euphonium. At loyola, I played as the lead trombone in the jazz band my senior year and was a constant example and leader for the three years I was in the band. For most of my time in the wind ensemble, I was the only euphonium player. This gave me <div class="bub-image" id="euph"></div>the opportunity to grow in my capacity to improve without peer feedback and to gauge my success to my own growth and accomplishment. I was constantly leading the low brass section and setting the example for the level of excellence I believe the band could perform at. I had the pleasure to perform many solos and a number of small group performances which allowed me to grow in my musical ability, my ability to prepare for deadlines and public performance, and my ability to maintain my composure in high pressure situations. I am thankful for my time in the band program at Loyola University and left with a legacy of leadership, standard setting, and greatness.
